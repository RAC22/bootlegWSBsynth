# BootlegWSBsynth

Streams the fast moving daily discussion thread of the [WallStreetBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) subreddit. Via text to speech synthesis. 

## Description

I used to listen to this website [WSBsynth.com](https://wsbsynth.com), which did practically the same thing. However it is now abandoned.. So I thought it would be a fun project to try and recreate.
I believe the original did the sysnthesis server side, and streamed to the clients. Which was probably more costly than it was worth. So in this iteration, the synthesis is all done client side, via the SpeechSynthesis Web API. The downside is that the voices available are os/browser dependent.  

User beware, I do not control the content that is displayed/read, as it is a live feed from a large community. Whos sense of humor and culture is often politically incorrect. "also why its so funny to me sometimes"

## Getting Started

Check out live via github pages @[BootlegWSBsynth](https://rac22.github.io/bootlegWSBsynth/)
I recommend the Google UK English-Male voice. As it adds an ironic sophistication to the absurdity.
